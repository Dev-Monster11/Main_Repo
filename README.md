Hello. Friend.
This is Marcus Tuner from Upwork.
How about your project(LightWeight Desktop App for Windows10/11 using WebView2) going?
We've already discussed the project specification and I've made some progress, pushed the codebase to your repository.

My upwork account is banned because of financial issue.
Could you please pay through paypal?
I hope to discuss further more about your project.

Are you available in Skype, Slack or Discord?

It's better to keep the realtime communication, check progress and discuss.
